ToDo App

run `bundle` assuming you have the bundler gem to get all the project depedencies

You should be able to run all tests by using `rspec spec`  

To run the rake task that provides the projects and their checklists you can run `rake todo:checklists:export`   

`rails s` to run the app and go to localhost:3000 in your browser 

Programming interviews are interesting in their constraint and freedom.  I decided to spend 
some time on this without going overboard since it can always be better.  I want to be respectful of your time
by doing a good job while at the same time having a balance of time in my own life outside of my job.

I did the best job I could by implementing everything you asked of me in the readme, adding unit and integration tests,
and making the UX of the app somewhat more enjoyable. I also refactored along the way and cleaned up code where I saw fit.

Below are some things I would have like to change or add to my app.

* A feature that lets you uncheck or uncross an item.  People make mistakes and once they cross off an item there is no way to undo it with the current app.
* A way to do a batch update of items that you want to move to a status of done.
* A filter to see the items that are done and cleared from a project.
* Some ajax sprinkled in would have been nice. I think this is the type of app that could be a SPA. I would have prioritized the items index page first.
  

Thanks kind human(s) for taking time to look at my code!  I would love to hear any and all feedback as I continue to strive to get better as a programmer.
